**Neural-Theft** is a high-performance, concurrent data pipeline written in Go that scrapes player stats from [Tracker.gg](https://tracker.gg) and stores them in a lightweight SQLite database.

- **Concurrency & Parallelism**: Leveraging Goâ€™s goroutines, channels, and rate limiting for efficient, safe, and scalable web scraping.
- **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns between configuration, scraping, data processing, and persistence.
- **Robust Data Pipeline**: From HTML parsing to API integration and database transactions, with error handling and context-based cancellation.
- **Testability & Maintenance**: Easily extendable components with unit-friendly interfaces and minimal external dependencies.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- **Concurrent Scraping Engine**: Utilizes the `colly` library alongside Goâ€™s concurrency primitives to fetch and parse hundreds of pages per minute without blocking or data races.
- **Rate-Limited API Integration**: Safe, token-authenticated calls to external APIs for UUID resolution, governed by `golang.org/x/time/rate` to respect service limits.
- **Transactional Persistence**: Batch commits to SQLite3 via `modernc.org/sqlite` with `INSERT OR IGNORE` semantics for idempotent inserts and efficient rollback.
- **Context-Aware Cancellation**: Graceful shutdown of all goroutines on user interrupt or error, ensuring no partial writes or resource leaks.
- **Verbose Logging**: Optional debug mode for real-time insights into scraping progress, API failures, and database operations.
